## 🗄 Database Configuration

### Database Name

```sql
ecommerce_db
```

### Create Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
```

Update your database credentials inside:

```properties
src/main/resources/application.properties
```

Example:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```
